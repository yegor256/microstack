A much faster alternative of [`HashStack`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashStack.html), 
for very small maps. 
It is also faster than
[FxHashStack](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash),
[hashbrown](https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown),
[ArrayStack](https://github.com/robjtede/tinymap),
[IndexStack](https://crates.io/crates/indexmap),
and _all_ others.
The smaller the map, the higher the performance. 
It was observed that when a map contains more than 20 keys, it may be better to use the standard 
[`HashStack`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashStack.html), since
the performance of `microstack::Stack` _may_ start to degrade. 
See the [benchmarking results](#benchmark) below.

**WELCOME**: 
Not all functions that you might expect to have in a map are implemented. 
I will appreciate if you contribute by implementing these 
[missing functions](https://github.com/yegor256/microstack/issues).

First, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
microstack = "0.0.12"
```

Then, use it like a standard hash map... well, almost:

```rust
use microstack::Stack;
let mut m : Stack<u64, &str, 10> = Stack::new(); // allocation on stack
m.insert(1, "foo");
m.insert(2, "bar");
assert_eq!(2, m.len());
```

Pay attention, here the map is created with an extra generic argument `10`. This is 
the total size of the map, which is allocated on stack when `::new()` is called. 
Unlike `HashStack`, the `Stack` doesn't use heap at all. If more than ten keys will be
added to the map, it will panic.

Read [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/microstack/latest/microstack/). The struct
[`microstack::Stack`](https://docs.rs/microstack/latest/microstack/struct.Stack.html) is designed as closely similar to 
[`std::collections::HashStack`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashStack.html) as possible.

## Benchmark

There is a summary of a simple benchmark, where we compared `microstack::Stack` with
a few other Rust maps, changing the total capacity of the map (horizontal axis).
We applied the same interactions 
([`benchmark.rs`](https://github.com/yegor256/microstack/blob/master/tests/benchmark.rs)) 
to them and measured how fast they performed. In the following table, 
the numbers over 1.0 indicate performance gain, 
while the numbers below 1.0 demonstrate performance loss.

The experiment [was performed](https://github.com/yegor256/microstack/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml) on 30-04-2023.
There were 1000000 repetition cycles.
The entire benchmark took 297s.

<!-- benchmark -->

As you see, the highest performance gain was achieved for the maps that were smaller than ten keys.
For the maps of just a few keys, the gain was enormous.

## How to Contribute

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:

```bash
$ cargo test -vv
```

If everything goes well, fork repository, make changes, send us a [pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run `cargo test` again. Also, 
run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.

Also, before you start making changes, run benchmarks:

```bash
$ rustup run nightly cargo bench
```

Then, after the changes you make, run it again. Compare the results. If your changes
degrade performance, think twice before submitting a pull request.
